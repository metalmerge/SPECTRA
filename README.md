![SPECTRA Logo](server/static/SPECTRA_with_text.png)

**Project Overview:**

The SPECTRA project, an acronym for Solar Panel Evaluation through Computer Vision and Advanced Techniques, is committed to automating the assessment of solar panel performance. By harnessing cutting-edge computer vision algorithms and advanced analytics, SPECTRA endeavors to streamline the identification of critical issues such as degradation, soiling, and damage. This project is characterized by a tailored image processing pipeline, designed to facilitate efficient monitoring and maintenance of solar installations. Ultimately, these endeavors contribute significantly to the advancement of renewable energy technologies, ensuring optimal efficiency and sustainability within the solar energy sector.
