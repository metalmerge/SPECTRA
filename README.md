# SPECTRA

Solar Panel Evaluation through Computer Vision and Advanced Techniques for Reliable Analysis

The research project, Solar Panel Evaluation through Computer Vision and Advanced Techniques for Reliable Analysis or SPECTRA for short, aims to automate the assessment of solar panel performance using computer vision algorithms and advanced analytics. By developing a custom image processing pipeline, the project seeks to identify issues like degradation, soiling, and damage, enabling efficient monitoring and maintenance of solar installations. Ultimately, this approach will enhance renewable energy technologies and ensure optimal efficiency and sustainability in the solar energy industry.
